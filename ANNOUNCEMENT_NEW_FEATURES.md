# 🎉 Bot Update - New Features Available! 🎉

Hey everyone! We've added some exciting new features to the Restock Tracker Bot to make it even more useful for tracking store visits and restocks!

## ✨ What's New

### 1. 📊 **Improved Lookup Display**

- **Store Type Separation**: Lookup results are now organized by store type (Target, Best Buy, Barnes & Noble) in separate, color-coded embeds
- **Better Organization**: No more scrolling through one long list - each store type has its own section for easier reading!

### 2. ⏰ **"Last Checked" Feature** (NEW!)

- **Mark Stores as Checked**: You can now report when you visit a store, even if there's no restock
- **Anonymous Reporting**: Your username stays private - only the check time is recorded
- **Custom Time Entry**: Set the exact time you checked the store (e.g., "10:00 AM") using easy dropdown menus
- **View Last Checked**: See when stores were last visited to help coordinate with other community members

### 3. 🔍 **Dynamic "View Last Checked" Button**

- **Two Options**:
  - **View All**: See all stores that have been checked, grouped by type
  - **Lookup Specific Store**: Search for a specific store's last checked status
- **Easy Navigation**: Simple dropdown menus make it quick to find what you need

### 4. 🛡️ **Enhanced Admin Tools**

- **Safer Clear Restocks**: The clear restocks command now includes:
  - ⚠️ Warning prompts before clearing
  - 💾 Automatic backups before any clearing operation
  - 🎯 Granular options:
    - Clear all restocks
    - Clear by specific store
    - Clear today's restocks
    - Clear previous week's restocks

### 5. 🕐 **Improved Timezone Handling**

- **Eastern Time Display**: All times now display correctly in Eastern timezone
- **Automatic DST Handling**: Automatically adjusts for Daylight Saving Time (EDT/EST)

## 🎯 How to Use the New Features

1. Go to your region's lookup channel (e.g., `#lookup-restocked-locations-va`)
2. Click the **"View Last Checked"** button
3. Select **"Lookup Specific Store"**
4. Choose the store type and location
5. Set the time you checked the store (or use current time)

## 💡 Why These Features Matter

- **Better Coordination**: Know when stores were last checked so you don't waste time visiting recently checked locations
- **More Information**: Track store visits even when there's no restock, giving a fuller picture of store activity
