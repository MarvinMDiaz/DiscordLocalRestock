# 🛍️ Discord Community Restock Tracker Bot – Full Project Spec

## 📌 Overview

Create a **Discord bot** that allows members to report store restocks using a slash command. The bot will log these reports, display recent restocks in clean embedded messages, and automatically clear out entries older than 7 days. This helps community members collaborate and track product availability in real time.

## 💾 JSON Format

Each restock entry is saved in `data.json` like this:

```json

    "location": "Springfield, VA",
    "reported_by": "user#1234",
